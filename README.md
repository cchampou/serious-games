# Serious Games online shop

## Inspiration

[getwelly.com](https://www.getwelly.com/) (playful bright colourful)

[swabtheworld.com](https://swabtheworld.com/en/) (nice colourful modern hipster style)

[moooi.com](https://www.moooi.com/en/) (very stylish)

[wetransfer.com](https://wetransfer.com/paper/home/de) (somewhat generic but still nice and friendly style)

[galleonandcaravan.com](https://galleonandcaravan.com/#about) (I liked this one cuz it's fancy and somehow expensive and exclusive)

## Structure

- [Shop folder](./shop) the single page landing page + future shop
- [Admin folder](./admin) future admin panel code
- [API folder](./api) future API code

## Features

For now, there is only a single page application, the "shop",
well, at least, for now it's a landing page.

## Roadmap

See [the project page on Github](https://github.com/users/cchampou/projects/4).
